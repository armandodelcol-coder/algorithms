# Repository Description

This respository is a collection of implementation of some algorithms that I have studied at moment, my intention is increment this sections of algorithms with other types of them and in more different programming languanges.

## Strucuture of files

So, I think is not necessary to explain, but, maybe, in the future will be a good decision. 

The algorithms are just separete by folder and in each folder has another folders with name of a programming language and the algorithm implementation in the language.
